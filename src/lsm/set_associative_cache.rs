//! Set-associative cache with CLOCK Nth-Chance eviction.
//!
//! Purpose: provide a compact, cache-line-friendly cache for LSM hot data.
//!
//! Invariants and safety rules:
//! - `WAYS` is in {2, 4, 16} and is a power of two.
//! - `TagT::BITS` is 8 or 16.
//! - `CLOCK_BITS` is 1, 2, or 4 (counts fit in a `u8`).
//! - `CACHE_LINE_SIZE` is a power of two; value alignment is a power of two
//!   (`VALUE_ALIGNMENT == 0` uses the value type's alignment).
//! - `CLOCK_HAND_BITS == log2(WAYS)`.
//! - `value_count_max` is a multiple of `WAYS` and `VALUE_COUNT_MAX_MULTIPLE`.
//! - Slots are occupied iff their count is non-zero; tags may be stale.
//! - Values are `Copy` and are not dropped; storage is reused without destructors.
//! - This cache is not thread-safe; callers must synchronize shared access.
//!
//! High-level algorithm:
//! 1. Hash the key to 64-bit entropy.
//! 2. Select a set with `fast_range` and derive a tag with `Tag::truncate`.
//! 3. On lookup, match tags, then confirm keys for occupied slots.
//! 4. On insert, scan from the clock hand, decrementing counts until a zero slot
//!    is found, then insert and advance the hand.
//!
//! Design choices:
//! - Tags are stored separately to keep hot metadata compact.
//! - Counts and clock hands are packed into 64-bit words to reduce overhead.
//! - Values are stored in an aligned buffer so each set is contiguous.
