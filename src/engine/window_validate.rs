//! Window-level validation against compiled rules.
//!
//! Purpose: run a compiled rule against a fixed-size window of bytes and record
//! findings while enforcing cheap gates and decode budgets.
//!
//! # Invariants
//! - Window ranges must be valid for the provided buffer.
//! - For `Variant::Raw`, match spans are in raw byte space; for UTF-16 variants,
//!   match spans are in decoded UTF-8 byte space.
//! - `root_hint` (when present) is expressed in the same coordinate space as
//!   `base_offset` and anchors findings back to the parent stream.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//! 1. Apply cheap byte gates (must-contain, confirm-all, keyword gate).
//!    For UTF-16 variants, confirm-all and keywords run on raw bytes *before*
//!    decode; must-contain runs on decoded UTF-8 *after* decode.
//! 2. Apply assignment-shape precheck (when configured).
//! 3. Apply character-class distribution gate (when configured) — SIMD-accelerated
//!    rejection of windows dominated by lowercase ASCII.
//! 4. For UTF-16 variants, decode with per-window and total-output budgets.
//!    Steps 2–3 run on the raw window for `Variant::Raw` but on the decoded
//!    UTF-8 buffer for UTF-16 variants (i.e., after this step).
//! 5. Run regex with reusable capture locations to access capture groups.
//! 6. Extract the secret span using capture group priority (see [`extract_secret_span_locs_raw`]).
//! 7. Apply entropy gate on the *extracted secret*. `Failed` vetoes the finding;
//!    the outcome is captured in [`GateEvidence`] for confidence scoring.
//! 8. Probe for keyword evidence in local context (±`KEYWORD_EVIDENCE_RADIUS` bytes
//!    around the full match). Result stored in [`GateEvidence`].
//! 9. Apply value suppressors (when configured) on the extracted secret bytes.
//! 10. Apply local context checks (when configured) on the secret span.
//! 11. Apply root-context safelist suppression for root emit paths.
//! 12. Apply secret-bytes safelist suppression (all findings, including decoded).
//! 13. Apply UUID-format quick-reject: suppress findings whose extracted value is
//!     a bare UUID (8-4-4-4-12 hex), unless the rule opts out via
//!     `uuid_format_secret()`.
//! 14. Apply offline structural validation (CRC, charset, etc.) for root-semantic findings.
//! 15. Compute additive confidence score from [`GateEvidence`], rule flags, and
//!     emit-policy outcome (see `compute_confidence_score`).
//! 16. Apply per-rule `min_confidence` threshold — suppress findings below floor.
//! 17. Record the finding with the extracted secret span.
//!
//! # Secret Extraction
//! The finding's `span_start`/`span_end` reflect the *secret* portion of the match,
//! not necessarily the full regex match. The `root_hint_*` fields use the *full match*
//! span (not secret span or window span) to ensure correct deduplication in chunked
//! scans: `drop_prefix_findings()` uses `root_hint_end` to decide whether to keep a
//! finding. Using the full match span handles trailing context correctly (e.g., when
//! a pattern like `secret([a-z]+)(?:;|$)` has a delimiter that extends into new bytes).
//!
//! The extraction priority is:
//! 1. Configured `secret_group` if present and non-empty.
//! 2. First non-empty capture group (1..N). Gitleaks convention places
//!    secrets in group 1, but rules with alternation (e.g., `curl-auth-header`)
//!    may fire a higher group.
//! 3. Full match (group 0) as fallback.
//!
//! # Design Choices
//! - Keyword/confirm gates run on raw UTF-16 bytes to avoid wasting decode budget.
//! - UTF-16 findings attach a `DecodeStep::Utf16Window` so callers can map
//!   decoded spans back to parent byte offsets.
//! - Capture locations are reused per rule to avoid per-match allocations in hot paths.
//! - Evidence collection (steps 7–8) is separated from scoring (step 15) so that
//!   suppress-only gates (steps 9–14) can veto a finding without computing a
//!   score, and all four emission sites share a single scoring function via
//!   [`GateEvidence`].
//!
//! # Entry Points
//! - `run_rule_on_window`: engine hot path that writes findings directly into
//!   `ScanScratch`, applying safelist suppression + dedupe/drop-hint bookkeeping.
//! - `run_rule_on_raw_window_into` / `run_rule_on_utf16_window_into`: scheduler
//!   adapters that accumulate findings in `scratch.tmp_findings` for the caller
//!   to batch-commit.

    ///   regardless of step, catching placeholder values in decoded buffers.
    /// - Findings may be suppressed by offline structural validation using the
