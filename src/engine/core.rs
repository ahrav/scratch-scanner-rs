//! Core scanning engine: compilation, prefiltering, and scan orchestration.
//!
//! ## Purpose
//!
//! Compile rule specs and transform configs into prefilter databases (Vectorscan),
//! gating structures (Base64 YARA gate, keyword/entropy gates), and compiled
//! regexes. Then drive bounded scans over raw and decoded buffers.
//!
//! ## Invariants
//!
//! - Inputs passed to `scan_*` must be chunked so `buf.len() <= u32::MAX`.
//! - [`ScanScratch`] is single-threaded and must not be shared across threads.
//! - The decode slab does not reallocate during a scan; all `unsafe` slice
//!   construction relies on this property.
//! - `scratch.out`, `scratch.drop_hint_end`, and `scratch.norm_hash` stay
//!   length-aligned throughout a scan; all finding writes preserve this
//!   lock-step invariant.
//!
//! ## Algorithm
//!
//! ### Build phase (`new` / `new_with_anchor_policy`)
//!
//! Compile each [`RuleSpec`](crate::api::RuleSpec) into a [`RuleCompiled`]
//! with precompiled regexes and optional gates.
//! Derive anchor patterns from regex analysis (or use manual anchors per
//! policy). Build deduped pattern maps for raw + UTF-16 variants.
//! Construct Vectorscan prefilter DBs (raw, UTF-16, stream, gate) and
//! the Base64 YARA pre-gate.
//!
//! ### Scan phase (`scan_chunk_into`)
//!
//! Run Vectorscan prefilter on root buffer to populate touched pairs.
//! Enqueue `ScanBuf(root)` into the work queue.
//! Process work items in FIFO order:
//!   - `ScanBuf`: validate regexes in prefilter windows (see
//!     [`buffer_scan`](super::buffer_scan)), then discover transform spans
//!     and enqueue `DecodeSpan` items.
//!   - `DecodeSpan`: decode the span, then enqueue a `ScanBuf` for the
//!     decoded output.
//! - Budgets (decode bytes, work items, depth) are enforced per-item so no
//!   single input forces unbounded work.
//! - Apply suppression/cap policies at finding emission time so most
//!   findings are handled inline. A final post-scan compaction pass
//!   (`post_scan_filter`) removes root findings that fail offline
//!   structural validation.
//!
//! ## Design choices
//!
//! - Engine construction fails fast if required prefilter DBs cannot be built.
//! - Base64 pre-gates are conservative: they only skip decode work when no
//!   anchor *could* appear. Decoded-space validation remains authoritative.
//! - Raw regex patterns are included in the Vectorscan prefilter DB only for
//!   rules with weak or missing literal anchors (< 5 bytes). Rules with strong
//!   anchors rely on anchor-pattern matching alone, reducing DB size.
//! - Suppression gates are monotonic: they may remove findings after validation
//!   but never mutate span or decode provenance for findings that remain.
