//! Per-scan scratch state, entropy histogram, and root-span coordinate mapping.
//!
//! This module hosts [`ScanScratch`], the primary allocation amortization
//! vehicle for scans, [`EntropyScratch`] for entropy gating calculations, and
//! [`RootSpanMapCtx`] for translating decoded-byte offsets back to root-buffer
//! coordinates during transform scans. Scratch state is single-threaded and
//! reused across chunks to keep the hot path allocation-free.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! `ScanScratch` uses a `#[repr(C)]` layout with an explicit 64-byte cache-line
//! boundary separating hot-path fields (findings, work queue, hit accumulators)
//! from cold fields (decode slab, ring buffer, Vectorscan scratch). See the
//! struct-level docs for the full field map.
//!
//! # Lifecycle
//!
//! 1. Allocate via [`ScanScratch::new`] — pre-sizes all buffers to the engine's
//!    tuning parameters.
//! 2. Per-chunk: call [`ScanScratch::reset_for_scan`] (or
//!    [`ScanScratch::reset_for_scan_after_prefilter`]) to clear per-scan state
//!    while preserving allocations.
//! 3. Scan: the engine populates findings, work items, and decode steps.
//! 4. Drain: [`ScanScratch::drain_findings`] or
//!    [`ScanScratch::drain_findings_with_hashes`] extracts results.
