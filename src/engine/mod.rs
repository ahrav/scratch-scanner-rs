//! Core scanning engine: compiles rule specs into anchors/gates and executes
//! bounded scans with reusable scratch allocations.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//! 1. Compile rules into anchor patterns, confirm-all literals, and keyword gates.
//! 2. Prefilter input buffers (Vectorscan / gates) to build candidate windows.
//! 3. Validate windows with regexes/validators and record compact findings.
//! 4. Optionally decode transform spans into derived buffers and repeat via BFS.
//! 5. Apply suppression policies at finding emission sites before final output.
//!
//! # Module Layout
//! - `core`: immutable engine configuration and compiled rule state.
//! - `scratch`: per-scan mutable buffers, counters, and decode provenance.
//! - `buffer_scan`, `window_validate`, `stream_decode`: runtime scan pipeline
//!   stages that populate and consume scratch state.
//! - `decode_state`, `work_items`, `hit_pool`: bounded scheduling/storage helpers
//!   for decoded work.
//! - `transform`, `safelist`, `helpers`: supporting logic reused by scan stages.
//! - `vectorscan_prefilter`, `vs_cache`: Vectorscan database build/load/runtime
//!   integration.
//!
//! # Invariants
//! - The engine is immutable after construction; all mutable scan state lives in
//!   [`ScanScratch`], which is single-threaded and reused across scans.
//! - Scratch buffers are reused across scans and must be reset between scans.
//! - Decoded buffers are stored in an append-only slab; ranges and `StepId`
//!   references are only valid until the next `ScanScratch::reset_for_scan`.
//! - Offsets stored in hot paths use `u32`; callers must chunk inputs so buffer
//!   lengths fit in `u32`.
//! - `SpanU32` and `BufRef::Slab` ranges are only valid until the next reset.
//! - All per-scan work is bounded by tuning limits: windows, hits, findings,
//!   decode output bytes, transform depth, and work items.
//! - UTF-16 anchors always contain at least one NUL byte, enabling a raw-only
//!   fast path for NUL-free buffers.
//!
//! # Span Semantics
//! - Raw findings report byte offsets in the scanned buffer.
//! - UTF-16 variant findings report spans in decoded UTF-8 bytes and attach a
//!   [`DecodeStep::Utf16Window`] that records the source UTF-16 window.
//! - Findings from decoded/transformed buffers report spans in derived buffers;
//!   the decode step chain provides provenance back to the root input.
//!
//! # Safety
//! - Unsafe slices are formed only from ranges validated against the root buffer,
//!   the decode slab, or scratch-owned temporary buffers; those buffers are not
//!   reallocated while the slices are in use.
//!
//! # Design Notes
//! - The engine favors predictable cost over perfect precision: span/anchor
//!   selection is permissive, while validation and gates enforce correctness.
//! - Prefilters (Vectorscan, base64 pre-gate) are conservative: they may admit
//!   false positives but must not drop true matches.
//! - Suppression policies (for example, safelist/value suppressor checks) are
//!   intended to be monotonic: they may remove candidate findings, but must not
//!   alter span/provenance for findings that remain.
//!
//! # Failure Modes and Limits
//! - Raw Vectorscan prefilter DB build failures are fatal (fallback disabled).
//! - UTF-16 prefilter DB build or scan failures disable UTF-16 anchor scans
//!   for the affected buffer.
//! - Budget enforcement may coalesce windows, skip deeper decode work, or drop
//!   findings; dropped findings are counted in
//!   [`ScanScratch::dropped_findings`].
//! - Stream decoding may fall back to full decode when window caps or budgets
//!   are exceeded; correctness is preserved at the cost of throughput.
