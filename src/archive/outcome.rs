//! Stable, explicit outcome codes for archive scanning.
//!
//! Every archive encounter produces one of three outcomes:
//!
//! 1. **Skipped** — the archive or entry was rejected *before* any payload bytes
//!    were scanned. This covers policy gates (disabled, encrypted, unsupported
//!    format) and pre-scan budget checks (depth, entry count, metadata cap).
//!    Tracked by [`ArchiveSkipReason`] (whole archive) and [`EntrySkipReason`]
//!    (single entry within an archive).
//! 2. **Partial** — scanning *began* and some decompressed bytes were produced
//!    and scanned, but a limit or integrity error stopped further progress.
//!    Already-scanned bytes are **not** discarded — the scan results for those
//!    bytes are retained. Tracked by [`PartialReason`].
//! 3. **Scanned** — the archive (or entry) was fully decompressed and scanned
//!    without hitting any limit.
//!
//! The distinction between Skip and Partial matters because Partial archives
//! still contribute scan results for the bytes they did process, while Skipped
//! archives contribute nothing.
//!
//! [`ArchiveStats`] aggregates per-reason counters and a bounded sample buffer
//! ([`ArchiveSampleRing`]) across all three tiers.  Stats are accumulated
//! per-worker and merged upward via [`ArchiveStats::merge_from`], so all
//! operations are `Copy`-friendly and allocation-free.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Enums are `#[repr(u8)]` with explicit discriminants; new variants must be
//!   appended at the end with the next sequential discriminant.
//! - Each enum's `COUNT` constant must equal the last variant's discriminant + 1.
//! - Per-reason counter arrays are indexed by casting the discriminant to `usize`,
//!   so discriminant order and array layout must stay in sync.
//! - The module-level iteration tables (`ARCHIVE_SKIP_REASONS`, etc.) must list
//!   variants in discriminant order; tests assert this alignment.
//! - Samples are bounded and store only a path prefix (never unbounded strings).
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - Allocation-free on hot paths: all types are `Copy` and fixed-size.
//! - Bounded samples make skip/partial behavior observable in diagnostics
//!   without log spam or unbounded memory growth.
//! - All `record_*` methods compile to no-ops in release builds (gated behind
//!   `cfg!(all(feature = "perf-stats", debug_assertions))`), so the overhead
//!   on production scan throughput is zero.
