//! Budget tracking for archive expansion/scanning.
//!
//! Prevents resource exhaustion from zip bombs and deeply nested archives by
//! enforcing hard caps on entry counts, decompressed output, metadata, nesting
//! depth, and inflation ratio.  An optional wall-clock deadline can be configured
//! via [`ArchiveConfig::max_wall_clock_secs_per_root`] for CPU-exhaustion
//! defense; when `None`, the struct remains purely deterministic and
//! `is_deadline_expired()` is a no-op.
//!
//! # Budget Hierarchy
//!
//! Three nested scopes, each with independent caps:
//!
//! ```text
//! Root (per-source-file)
//!  └─ Archive (per-container: zip, tar, tar.gz, …)
//!      └─ Entry (per-file inside the container)
//! ```
//!
//! When charging decompressed output the tightest remaining allowance across
//! all three scopes wins, and the corresponding [`BudgetHit`] variant is
//! returned so callers can decide whether to skip just the entry, mark the
//! archive partial, or stop the entire root.
//!
//! Inflation-ratio enforcement runs at both archive and entry scopes:
//! `archive_out <= archive_in * R` and, while an entry scope is open,
//! `entry_out <= entry_in * R`.  Per-entry ratio tracking is independent of
//! archive-level ratio credit, preventing a credit-accumulation attack where
//! many small well-compressed entries build up archive-level headroom that a
//! single malicious entry later exploits.
//!
//! # Caller Protocol
//!
//! ```text
//! new(cfg) / reset()
//!   enter_archive()          ← push a frame, enforce depth cap
//!     note_entry() / begin_entry()   ← count + optionally open entry scope
//!       charge_metadata(n)
//!       charge_compressed_in(n)
//!       charge_decompressed_out(n) / charge_discarded_out(n)
//!     end_entry(scanned)     ← close entry scope
//!   exit_archive()           ← pop frame
//! ```
//!
//! `enter_archive`/`exit_archive` and `begin_entry`/`end_entry` must be
//! balanced.  Calling charge methods without an active frame is safe (returns
//! a clamp-to-zero result).
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - All byte/count accounting is deterministic and reproducible. The
//!   wall-clock deadline is a separate, opt-in layer: only the
//!   `is_deadline_expired()` predicate introduces non-determinism (it reads
//!   `Instant::now()`). It does not affect byte or count accounting — callers
//!   poll it at natural loop boundaries as an early-exit check.
//! - All accounting is saturating; overflows are treated as budget hits.
//! - If no archive frame is active, charge methods clamp to 0 and remaining
//!   allowance is 0.
//! - The frame stack index (`depth - 1`) is always valid when `depth > 0`.
//!   This is the safety invariant for `cur()`/`cur_mut()` and is formally
//!   verified by the Kani proof `verify_budget_cur_bounds`.
//!
//! # Design Notes
//!
//! - This module does **not** perform I/O or decompression.
//! - Per-entry vs per-archive limits are separated to avoid ambiguity.
//! - The frame stack is preallocated to `max_archive_depth` and never grows
//!   after startup (no `Vec` push/pop on hot paths).
