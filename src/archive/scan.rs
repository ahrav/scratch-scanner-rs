//! Archive scanning core with a sink-driven entry interface.
//!
//! # Scope
//! - Streaming archive parsing (gzip/tar/tar.gz/zip) with deterministic budgets.
//! - Virtual path construction + path budget enforcement.
//! - Entry scanning is delegated to an [`ArchiveEntrySink`] to avoid coupling
//!   to the pipeline or simulation harness.
//!
//! # Entry points
//!
//! | Function | Format | Access pattern |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`scan_gzip_stream`] | `.gz` | Sequential (`Read`) |
//! | [`scan_tar_stream`] | `.tar` (plain or wrapped) | Sequential (`TarRead`) |
//! | [`scan_targz_stream`] | `.tar.gz` | Sequential (`Read`) |
//! | [`scan_zip_source`] | `.zip` | Random access (`ZipSource`) |
//!
//! # Sliding-window read loop
//!
//! Every entry payload is read using the same pattern (shared across gzip,
//! tar, and zip code paths):
//!
//! ```text
//! stream_buf layout on each iteration:
//!
//!   |<-- carry (overlap) -->|<--- new read (up to chunk_size) --->|
//!   ^                       ^
//!   buf[0]                  buf[carry]
//!
//! carry = overlap.min(bytes_emitted_so_far)
//! ```
//!
//! Before each read, the last `carry` bytes of the previous chunk are
//! copied to the front of `stream_buf` so that downstream pattern matchers
//! see a sliding window with `overlap` bytes of look-behind context.
//! Budget checks happen *after* the read returns: bytes beyond the budget
//! are truncated (`allowed < n`) and the loop exits.
//!
//! # Budget lifecycle
//!
//! Each scan function follows the same budget protocol (see [`ArchiveBudgets`]):
//!
//! ```text
//! reset() → enter_archive()
//!   ├─ begin_entry() / begin_entry_scan()
//!   │   ├─ charge_compressed_in()   (raw bytes consumed)
//!   │   ├─ charge_decompressed_out() (payload bytes delivered to sink)
//!   │   ├─ charge_discarded_out()    (payload bytes read but dropped)
//!   │   └─ end_entry(scanned)
//!   ├─ … (repeat per entry)
//!   └─ exit_archive()
//! ```
//!
//! Budget violations never panic: they return a [`BudgetHit`] that maps
//! deterministically to [`ArchiveEnd::Partial`] or [`ArchiveEnd::Skipped`].
//!
//! # Locator suffixes
//!
//! Each virtual path is suffixed with a fixed-length *locator* so that
//! downstream consumers can re-seek to the exact entry within the archive:
//!
//! ```text
//! @t<16-hex-digits>   tar entry (header block index)
//! @z<16-hex-digits>   zip entry (local file header offset, when valid)
//! @c<16-hex-digits>   zip entry (CDFH offset, when LFH offset is invalid)
//! ```
//!
//! # Nested archive handling
//!
//! Tar entries whose names match a known archive extension (`.gz`, `.tar`,
//! `.tar.gz`) are recursively descended up to `max_archive_depth`. Zip
//! entries inside a tar stream cannot be recursed (no random access) and
//! are handled according to [`UnsupportedPolicy`](crate::archive::UnsupportedPolicy).
//! Recursion uses `split_first_mut` to peel per-depth scratch slices
//! without allocation.
//!
//! # Design notes
//! - No OS dependencies: callers provide `Read`/`Read+Seek` sources.
//! - All hot-path buffers live in [`ArchiveScratch`] and are reused.
//! - Chunk overlap is configured once at [`ArchiveScratch::new`] time and
//!   applied uniformly to every entry read loop.

/// 2. Directories, encrypted entries, and entries with unsupported
///    compression methods are handled according to the configured
///    [`EncryptedPolicy`](crate::archive::EncryptedPolicy) /

/// - No recursive nesting: each zip entry is scanned as raw bytes.

/// - Inflation-ratio pre-clamping is active only for deflate entries
///   (method 8); stored entries (method 0) have a 1:1 ratio.

/// # Errors
///
/// Sink errors propagate immediately. Budget and I/O failures map to
