//! Thread-local worker ID for per-worker fast path routing.
//!
//! # Purpose
//!
//! This module enables O(1) per-worker routing for buffer pool returns:
//! - Worker threads set their ID at startup via `set_current_worker_id(Some(id))`
//! - Buffer pool `release()` checks TLS to route to local queue first
//! - Non-worker threads (I/O completions) fall back to global queue
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Workers must clear TLS before exit to prevent mis-routing during thread teardown:
//! ```ignore
//! worker_id::set_current_worker_id(Some(worker_id)); // on startup
//! // ... work ...
//! worker_id::set_current_worker_id(None); // before exit
//! ```
//!
//! # Correctness Invariant
//!
//! `current_worker_id()` returns `Some(id)` **only** on active executor worker threads.
//! Any other thread (main, I/O, tests) sees `None`.

/// # Why `usize::MAX`?
///
/// - **Not a valid worker ID**: No executor will have 2^64 workers.
/// - **Branchless comparison**: `id == NO_WORKER` compiles to a single `cmp`.
/// - **No `Option` overhead**: Avoids the 1-byte discriminant + padding that
///   `Option<usize>` would add in TLS (minor, but TLS access is already slow).
///
/// Trade-off: Caller must not pass `usize::MAX` as a worker ID. This is enforced
/// by the executor (worker IDs are sequential from 0).
