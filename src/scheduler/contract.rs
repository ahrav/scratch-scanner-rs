//! # Scheduler Contract (Phase 0)
//!
//! Run-scoped identifiers, engine contract, and scheduler limits.
//!
//! This module defines the foundational types that establish the scheduler's
//! correctness guarantees. These types are intentionally simple and `Copy` to
//! allow cheap passing through the system without allocation overhead.
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! ```text

//! ```
//!
//! ## Non-negotiable invariants
//!
//! ### Work-conserving
//! - Backpressure delays work, never drops it.
//! - When limits prevent progress, the scheduler blocks or parks and resumes later.
//!
//! ### Exactly-once (within a run)
//! - Each object version is scanned exactly once within a run, unless explicitly
//!   configured otherwise.
//! - Retries are bounded and observable (attempt count, reason, backoff).
//!
//! ### Hard caps (tokens)
//! - in-flight objects
//! - in-flight reads
//! - buffered bytes (buffer pool / byte budget)
//! - queued tasks
//!
//! ### Budget invariance
//! - Per-object and per-chunk budgets must be enforced identically regardless
//!   of concurrency and completion order.
//!
//! ### Cancellation is leak-free
//! - Cancel is explicit and leak-free.
//! - Buffers and tokens are always returned exactly once, even on early exit paths.
