//! Shared hot-path helpers for chunked scanning.
//!
//! This module is the behavior-preserving core used by every I/O backend:
//! blocking filesystem reads ([`local_fs_owner`](super::local_fs_owner)),
//! io_uring ([`local_fs_uring`](super::local_fs_uring)), archive entry
//! streams ([`local_fs_archive_ctx`](super::local_fs_archive_ctx)), and
//! the connector pipeline ([`connector_pipeline`](super::connector_pipeline)).
//!
//! Centralizing here guarantees that all paths execute the same post-scan
//! pipeline — any divergence in finding semantics would be a correctness bug.
//!
//! # Post-scan pipeline (in order)
//!
//! 1. **`scan_chunk_into`** — engine produces raw findings into scratch.
//! 2. **Overlap-prefix pruning** (`drop_prefix_findings`) — removes findings
//!    whose `root_hint_end` falls within the overlap prefix, since those bytes
//!    are "owned" by the previous chunk and findings were already emitted there.
//! 3. **Cross-rule dedupe** — collapses findings that matched the same secret
//!    location across different rules, keeping the highest-confidence winner.
//! 4. **Effective dropped-finding accounting** — adjusts the engine's reported
//!    cap-drops by subtracting findings the scheduler would have pruned anyway
//!    (overlap + dedupe), so persistence-loss signals remain accurate.
//! 5. **Chunk/byte/finding metrics updates** — records payload bytes only
//!    (excluding overlap prefix) for accurate throughput measurement.

/// Copy prior-chunk overlap bytes to the front of `buf`.
///
/// The overlap carry pattern avoids re-reading bytes from disk: instead of
/// seeking back, we `copy_within` the tail of the previous chunk to the
/// buffer head, then fill the remainder with new payload bytes.
///
/// Call this before filling payload bytes for the next chunk. On the first
/// iteration both `have` and `carry` are 0, so this is a no-op.
///
/// # Preconditions
///
/// - `have` is the number of valid bytes currently in `buf`.
/// - `carry <= have` (the overlap cannot exceed the data available).

/// Scan one chunk and run the shared post-processing pipeline.
///
/// This is the single function that every I/O backend calls after assembling
/// a chunk buffer. It executes the full pipeline documented in the module-level
/// docs: scan → prefix prune → cross-rule dedupe → accounting → metrics.
///
/// After this function returns, `pending` contains the deduplicated findings
/// for this chunk, ready for emission and/or persistence. The caller is
/// responsible for emitting findings and clearing `pending` before the next call.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// - `data`: the assembled chunk buffer. May contain an overlap prefix at the
///   front; `prefix_len` specifies how many leading bytes belong to the previous
///   chunk. Findings whose `root_hint_end` falls within the prefix are pruned.
/// - `base_offset`: absolute file offset of `data[0]`.
/// - `prefix_len`: bytes of overlap prefix in `data`. For the first chunk this
///   is 0; for subsequent chunks it equals `min(overlap, previous_chunk_len)`.
/// - `file_id`: logical file identifier for engine attribution.
///
/// # Metrics
///
/// Only payload bytes (`data.len() - prefix_len`) are counted toward
/// `bytes_scanned` and `chunks_scanned` to avoid double-counting overlap.
#[inline(always)]
