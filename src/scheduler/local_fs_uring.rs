//! Local Filesystem Scanner with io_uring
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - I/O threads use io_uring for async reads
//! - CPU threads run the work-stealing executor for scanning
//! - Buffer ownership transfers: I/O thread acquires, CPU thread releases
//! - Overlap bytes are carried in-memory between chunks (payload-only reads)
//!
//! # Why io_uring?
//!
//! - High concurrency on cold storage (NVMe, network mounts)
//! - Batched syscalls reduce kernel overhead
//! - CPU workers never block on I/O
//!
//! # Correctness Guarantees
//!
//! - **Work-conserving**: Backpressure delays discovery, never drops files
//! - **Chunk overlap**: `engine.required_overlap()` bytes overlap between chunks
//! - **Budget bounded**: `max_in_flight_files` limits discovered-but-not-complete files
//! - **Buffer bounded**: `pool_buffers` limits peak memory
//! - **Exactly-once per chunk**: No duplicate scans
//!
//! # When to Use
//!
//! Profile first! io_uring may be slower than blocking reads when:
//! - Everything is in page cache
//! - Files are tiny (syscall overhead dominates)
//!
//! io_uring tends to win on:
//! - Cold cache workloads
//! - High-latency storage (network mounts)
//! - Many concurrent files
//!
//! # Platform
//!
//! Linux-only. Compiled unconditionally on `target_os = "linux"`.
