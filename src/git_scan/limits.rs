//! Hard caps and tunables for repo discovery and open.
//!
//! These limits are guardrails against unbounded metadata reads and
//! allocations during repo discovery. All limits are explicit and enforced;
//! exceeding a limit should surface as an error rather than silent truncation.
//!
//! # Design Notes
//! - Limits are validated at startup; invalid configurations are treated
//!   as programmer errors (panic in `validate`).
//! - Defaults favor large monorepos while staying within sensible memory bounds.
