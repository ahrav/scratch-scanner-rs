//! End-to-end Git scan runner — types, config, and thin dispatcher.
//!
//! This module defines the public types (`GitScanConfig`, `GitScanError`,
//! `GitScanReport`, etc.) and the [`run_git_scan`] entry point, which is a
//! thin dispatcher that delegates to mode-specific pipeline modules:
//!
//! | Module | Purpose |
//! |--------|---------|
//! | [`runner_odb_blob`](super::runner_odb_blob) | ODB-blob fast-path pipeline |
//! | [`runner_diff_history`](super::runner_diff_history) | Diff-history pipeline |
//! | [`runner_exec`](super::runner_exec) | Shared pack execution helpers |
//!
//! # Pipeline
//! 1. Open the repo (start set resolution, watermarks, artifact readiness check).
//! 2. Build MIDX and commit-graph in memory via `artifact_acquire`.
//! 3. Build commit plan (`introduced_by_plan`).
//! 4. Dispatch to mode-specific pipeline (ODB-blob or diff-history).
//! 5. Post-execution artifact stability check.
//! 6. Finalize, optionally persist, and return report.
//!
//! # Modes
//! - **Diff-history**: walk commits, diff trees, spill/dedupe candidates, then
//!   batch-plan and execute pack decode + scan.
//! - **ODB-blob fast**: compute the unique blob set from the commit graph,
//!   then scan in pack order with streaming plan generation; retries via
//!   spill/dedupe on candidate cap overflow.
//!
//! # Invariants
//! - MIDX completeness is verified before pack execution.
//! - Pack cache sizing must fit in `u32` (checked before execution).
//!
//! # Notes
//! - Loose objects are decoded via `PackIo::load_loose_object`; failures are
//!   recorded as skipped candidates.
//! - Persistence is optional; callers can run the pipeline without a store.

///
/// # Inputs
/// - `repo_root` must reference a Git repository with readable metadata.
/// - `resolver` controls how the start set is chosen (default branch, refs, etc.).
/// - `seen_store` is used to dedupe candidates across runs.
/// - `watermark_store` supplies existing ref watermarks; it is not mutated here.
/// - `persist_store` is optional; when `Some`, finalize output (including
///   watermarks on complete runs) is committed atomically.
///
/// If no persistence store is provided, the caller is responsible for
/// interpreting `FinalizeOutcome` and storing watermarks as needed.
///
/// # Returns
/// A `GitScanResult` containing the `GitScanReport` when the scan finishes.
///
/// # Errors
/// Returns `ConcurrentMaintenance` if artifacts changed during the scan,
/// indicating another process modified the repository.
/// Pack mmap limits and cache sizing may surface as `GitScanError::ResourceLimit`.
/// Missing or corrupt maintenance artifacts (commit-graph, MIDX) surface as
/// `GitScanError::CommitPlan` or `GitScanError::Midx`.
///
/// # Artifact stability checks
///
/// Artifact stability is validated twice:
/// 1. Immediately after MIDX acquisition (before expensive traversal).
/// 2. After mode execution, before finalize/persist.
///
/// This avoids persisting results derived from pack offsets that changed
/// while the scan was in flight (for example due to concurrent `git gc`).
///
/// # Commit-meta emission
///
/// A [`CommitGraphIndex`] and shared [`AtomicBitSet`] are constructed from
/// the commit graph before mode dispatch. Both are passed (via `Arc`) to
/// every `EngineAdapter` created during pack execution and loose scanning,
/// enabling exactly-once `CommitMeta` event emission per referenced commit
/// across all worker threads.
///
/// # Determinism
/// Pack plans are built in pack order, and parallel execution reassembles
/// results by pack (and shard) order before finalize. This keeps persisted
/// scan output stable even when multiple workers are used.
///
/// Structured event ordering is intentionally non-deterministic under parallel
/// workers: `commit_meta` and `finding` events may interleave across commits,
/// and a finding may appear before its matching commit metadata.
///
/// # Caveats
/// - Loose object decode failures are recorded as skipped candidates and may
///   yield a `FinalizeOutcome::Partial`, suppressing watermark writes.
