//! Engine adapter for Git blob scanning.
//!
//! Bridges decoded blob bytes into the core `Engine` using overlap-safe chunking
//! and a fixed-size ring buffer, then aggregates findings per blob with
//! deterministic ordering.
//!
//! # Per-blob pipeline
//!
//! Each blob flows through four stages:
//!
//! 1. **Classify** (`scan_blob_into_buf`) — text blobs are scanned directly,
//!    extractable binary formats (`.class`, `.pyc`, etc.) have their text
//!    extracted first, and opaque binaries are skipped.
//! 2. **Scan** — blob bytes are fed through overlap-safe chunk windows.
//!    Blobs that fit in a single chunk skip the ring buffer entirely
//!    (fast path); larger blobs stream through `RingChunker` (slow path).
//! 3. **Stream** (`stream_findings`) — findings are emitted to the
//!    structured `EventSink` for real-time consumption. A `CommitMeta`
//!    event is emitted at most once per commit via `AtomicBitSet`.
//! 4. **Record** (`record_findings`) — findings are appended to the shared
//!    arena and the resulting `FindingSpan` is attached to the `ScannedBlob`.
//!
//! # Chunking algorithm
//!
//! 1. Stream blob bytes into fixed windows using `RingChunker`.
//! 2. Scan each window with `Engine::scan_chunk_into` at the correct base offset.
//! 3. Drop findings that fall entirely inside the overlap prefix so each match
//!    is recorded exactly once.
//! 4. Convert findings into `FindingKey` values (no raw secret bytes).
//! 5. Sort + dedup per blob to guarantee deterministic ordering.
//!
//! # Design
//!
//! - Chunk overlap uses `Engine::required_overlap()` and
//!   `ScanScratch::drop_prefix_findings`.
//! - A fixed-size ring buffer streams blob bytes into the scanner, avoiding
//!   per-blob allocations beyond the chunk window.
//! - Findings are stored in a shared arena with per-blob spans, so individual
//!   blobs reference contiguous slices rather than owning separate `Vec`s.
//! - `CommitMeta` events are emitted at most once per commit using an
//!   `AtomicBitSet` shared across all adapter instances. See
//!   [`EngineAdapter::stream_findings`] for the exactly-once protocol.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - Results are returned in candidate order.
//! - `ScannedBlob.findings` indexes into the adapter's findings arena.
//! - Path refs in results point into the mapping arena supplied by the caller.
//! - When the debug allocation guard is enabled, scanning must not allocate.
