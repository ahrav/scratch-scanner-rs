//! Hard caps and tunables for Git maintenance preflight.

//! All limits are explicit and enforced for file reads. Pack count is tracked
//! as a maintenance recommendation threshold, not a hard gate. These bounds
//! keep preflight fast and deterministic by capping file reads and the
//! maximum number of pack files inspected across object stores.
//!
//! # Invariants
//! - Limits are validated at construction and in const contexts.
//! - Pack count thresholds are advisory; readiness is determined elsewhere.
