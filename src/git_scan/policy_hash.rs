//! Policy hash canonicalization for Git scanning.
//!
//! Incremental Git scans persist watermarks keyed by
//! `(repo_id, policy_hash, start_set_id, ref_name)` and seen-blob sets
//! keyed by `(repo_id, policy_hash, oid)`. When the scanning
//! policy changes -- different rules, different tuning, different merge
//! strategy -- cached state is no longer valid: a blob marked "seen" under
//! the old policy may produce different findings under the new one. The
//! policy hash detects these changes so the pipeline can discard stale
//! caches and force a full rescan.
//!
//! The hash is a BLAKE3 digest over a canonical byte encoding of:
//! - **Rule specs** (canonicalized and order-invariant)
//! - **Transform configs** (order-preserving, since pipeline order matters)
//! - **Tuning parameters**
//! - **Merge diff mode**
//!
//! # Encoding format
//!
//! The byte stream is a sequence of tagged sections. Each section starts
//! with an ASCII tag name, a null separator byte, and the section payload.
//! The first section carries the format version so that any structural
//! change to the encoding (new sections, reordered fields) can be made
//! unambiguously by bumping [`POLICY_HASH_VERSION`].
//!
//! This format is write-only: the output is never parsed, only hashed.
//!
//! # Fields deliberately excluded
//!
//! `RuleSpec::local_context`, `RuleSpec::uuid_format_secret`, and
//! `RuleSpec::min_confidence` are not encoded by
//! [`RuleSpec::encode_policy`](crate::api::RuleSpec). These fields affect
//! post-extraction suppression/thresholding rather than core detection
//! (anchor matching, window construction, regex evaluation), so changing
//! them is accepted as a minor staleness trade-off rather than forcing a
//! full rescan.
//!
//! # Invariants
//! - Identical inputs yield identical hashes across platforms and runs.
//! - Rule ordering does not affect the hash (rules are sorted after
//!   individual encoding).
//! - Any change in the fields encoded by `encode_policy` produces a
//!   distinct byte stream, yielding a different hash with overwhelming
//!   probability.
//! - Bumping `POLICY_HASH_VERSION` invalidates all previous hashes,
//!   forcing full rescans.
