//! Persistence store contract and helpers.
//!
//! This module defines the write-only persistence API used after finalize.
//! Persistence must commit data and watermark ops atomically to prevent
//! advancing ref tips past unscanned blobs.
//!
//! # Atomic contract
//! - `data_ops` are always safe to write.
//! - `watermark_ops` are only written for `FinalizeOutcome::Complete`.
//! - Implementations must commit the combined operation atomically so that
//!   readers never observe watermarks without the corresponding data writes.

/// Persistence store interface for finalize output.
///
/// Implementations must commit `data_ops` and (when complete) `watermark_ops`
/// in a single atomic write. On partial runs, `watermark_ops` must be ignored,
/// ensuring ref tips never advance past unscanned content.
