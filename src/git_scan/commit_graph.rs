//! Commit-graph indexing helpers for attribution-first ODB scans.
//!
//! This module provides a cache-friendly view over commit-graph data. It
//! precomputes commit OIDs, root tree OIDs, and committer timestamps into
//! flat arrays so hot-path lookups avoid per-commit graph access.
//!
//! # Invariants
//! - Arrays are sized to the commit-graph `num_commits()` and never grow.
//! - Positions are used as direct indices into the arrays.
//! - OID lengths always match the repo's object format.
//! - The index is immutable after construction; all reads are O(1).
