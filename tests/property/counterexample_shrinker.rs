//! Tests for the custom [`MutationPlanValueTree`] shrinker.
//!
//! These tests validate the shrinker's state machine by driving it through
//! `simplify()` / `complicate()` cycles with synthetic predicates — the same
//! contract that proptest's internal test runner uses. Each test targets a
//! specific property of well-behaved shrinking:
//!
//! - **Monotonicity**: shrinking never increases plan complexity.
//! - **Determinism**: identical seeds produce identical shrink sequences.
//! - **Validity**: every intermediate candidate satisfies the family's op
//!   constraints.
//! - **Minimality**: the shrinker converges to a near-minimal plan that still
//!   satisfies the predicate.
//! - **Context convergence**: unrestricted shrinking drives context to `Raw`.
//! - **Robustness**: edge cases (empty ops, interleaved simplify/complicate)
//!   do not panic.
//!
//! No scanner engine internals are invoked; the tests exercise only the
//! generation and shrinking layers from [`super::proptest_support`].
