//! Finding-to-truth matching for PRC-AUC evaluation.
//!
//! Classifies each [`NormalizedFinding`] against [`TruthItem`] annotations to
//! produce [`FindingClass`] labels (TP, FP, or Unlabeled) that feed into
//! precision/recall computation.
//!
//! # Algorithm
//!
//! Uses confidence-sorted greedy matching, the same strategy as COCO and
//! PASCAL VOC evaluation protocols:
//!
//! 1. Sort findings by confidence descending (deterministic tiebreak via
//!    [`NormalizedFinding::Ord`]).
//! 2. Group truth items by file path, sort each group by `line_start`.
//! 3. For each finding (highest confidence first):
//!    - Convert byte range to line range via [`LineIndex`].
//!    - Binary search for overlapping truth items.
//!    - Apply label priority: Positive > Negative > Placeholder.
//!    - Consume matched Positive truths (one-to-one TP counting).
//!
//! Greedy matching is **required** for valid PRC-AUC: it produces nested TP
//! sets across confidence thresholds, ensuring recall is monotonically
//! non-decreasing as the threshold decreases. Optimal (Hungarian) matching
//! violates this property.
//!
//! # Consumption rules
//!
//! - **Positive** truth items are consumed on match (one-to-one), preventing
//!   metric inflation where multiple findings inflate the TP count.
//! - **Negative** truth items are **not** consumed — they describe regions, not
//!   tokens. Multiple findings at a negative region should all be classified FP.
//! - **Placeholder** truth items are **not** consumed — multiple findings at an
//!   ignore region should all be excluded from scoring (Unlabeled).

// 2. **Property tests** (proptest) — randomized scenarios verifying global
//    invariants that must hold for *all* inputs:
//    - Conservation: tp + fp + unlabeled == findings count, tp + fn == positives.
//    - Determinism: identical inputs always produce identical output.
//    - One-to-one: TP count never exceeds positive truth count.
//    - Path isolation: findings on path A never match truths on path B.
//    - Label consistency: no TP without Positive truths, no FP without Negatives.
//    - Placeholder neutrality: adding/removing Placeholders cannot change TP/FP.
//    - Recall monotonicity: recall never decreases as the confidence threshold
//      drops (required for valid PRC-AUC).
